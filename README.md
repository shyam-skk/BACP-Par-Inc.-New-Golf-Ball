# BACP-Par-Inc.-New-Golf-Ball
Par Inc., is a major manufacturer of golf equipment. Management believes that Par’s market share could be increased with the introduction of a cut-resistant, longer-lasting golf ball. Therefore, the research group at Par has been investigating a new golf ball coating designed to resist cuts and provide a more durable ball. The tests with the coating have been promising. But researchers at Par Inc. is concern about the effect of the new coating on driving distances. Par would like the new cut-resistant ball to offer driving distances comparable to those of the current-model golf ball.

To compare the driving distances for the two balls, 40 balls of both the new and current models
were selected and subjected to distance tests. The testing was performed with a mechanical
hitting machine so that any difference between the mean distances for the two models could
be attributed to a difference in the design. The results of the tests, with distances measured to
the nearest yard, are contained in the data set “Golf”. Company want to prepare a managerial
report based on statistical analysis on the dataset “Golf”, for addressing the following issues.


    1. Formulate and present the rationale for a hypothesis test that par could use to compare
    the driving distances of the current and new golf balls

    2. Analyze the data to provide the hypothesis testing conclusion. What is the p-value for
    your test? What is your recommendation for Par Inc.?

    3. Provide descriptive statistical summaries of the data for each model

    4. What is the 95% confidence interval for the population mean of each model, and what is
    the 95% confidence interval for the difference between the means of the two
    population?

    5. Do you see a need for larger sample sizes and more testing with the golf balls?
